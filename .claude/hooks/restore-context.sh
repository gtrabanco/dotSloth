# SessionStart hook (OPT-IN) — re-injects the last session-log entry as context
# when a session begins, so you resume cold without re-reading docs/LOGS.md.
#
# No model, no tokens spent generating anything: it just reads the last entry
# and prints it. The ONLY cost is the input-context tokens of that entry at
# every session start — which is why this hook is opt-in. Keep entries short to
# keep that cost negligible.
#
# Wire it up in .claude/settings.json (see settings.json.example). Anything this
# script prints to stdout is added to the session as additionalContext.
