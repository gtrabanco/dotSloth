# Session log

Append-only journal of working sessions — the context git history doesn't
record. A commit says *what* changed; an entry here says what the session set
out to do, what you decided, and where to resume.

**How it gets written**

- **Automatically (free)** — the SessionEnd hook in `.claude/` appends a
  *mechanical* entry (timestamp, branch, commits, files) on every `/clear` and
  exit. No model, no tokens. See [`.claude/README.md`](../.claude/README.md).
- **Manually (rich)** — run `/log-session` to add a thoughtful entry with a
  summary, the decisions made, and the concrete next step. Do it before
  `/clear`, before closing for the day, or at any natural stopping point.

Newest entries go at the **bottom** (chronological, append-only). Don't edit
or "tidy" past entries — they're a record.

## Entry format

```markdown
## <ISO-8601 timestamp> — <branch> — manual
- **Commits:** <n> (`<short-sha>…<short-sha>`)
- **Files:** <paths, or a count if many>
- **Summary:** <what this session did>          (manual only)
- **Decisions:** <key choices + why; omit the line if none>
- **Next:** <the concrete next step>            (manual only)
```

## 2026-07-03T10:44:20Z — main — manual
- **Commits:** 1 (`750cbab...87ef183`)
- **Files:** bin/dot, scripts/core/src/output.sh, scripts/package/src/recipes/dotbot_git.sh, scripts/core/loader
- **Summary:** Fixed critical bugs in core loader, dotbot recipe, and fzf prompt. Performed triage on issue #202.
- **Decisions:** 
  - Fixed issue #227 by correcting shell parameter expansion escaping in `loader`.
  - Fixed issue #221 by ensuring `dotbot_git::is_outdated` returns `1` when the package manager is not `registry`.
  - Fixed fzf selection bug by removing `--print0` in `bin/dot` to prevent null-byte command termination.
  - Triage issue #202: Closed as `wontfix` (obsolete) as the fix was merged in PR #204 in 2022.
- **Next:** Continue with remaining issues or proceed with agentic-workflow scaffold migration.
